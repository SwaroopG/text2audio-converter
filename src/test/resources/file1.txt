It was true that the store was in a worrying state.

“What are you talking about?”

“Eh?”

Shin was startled with the question that he didn’t know what to answer. He seemed to have spoken his mind unconsciously. As he turned to the direction of the voice, he saw an elven girl with black hair and golden eyes from the other side of the counter. A pointed ear can be seen between the silky black hair, so he might be correct.

If ten people saw her, they would all be admiring her beauty. She had a beautiful appearance that matched perfectly with her figure. Her height was approximately 160 cemels which was one head lower than Shin’s height. Her skin was healthy white and her chest was very firm and proportionate with her overall slim body.

From her looks, she seemed to be around 17 or 18 years old, but as elves lived a long life, she might have already lived several hundred years.

“Ahh, I was seeing what kind of goods you have.”
